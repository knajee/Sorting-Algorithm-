Sorting Algorithms Implementation and Analysis
This repository contains implementations of four classic sorting algorithms in Python, along with performance analysis under different scenarios.
 Algorithms Implemented

Bubble Sort

Time Complexity: O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Stable: Yes
In-place: Yes


Selection Sort

Time Complexity: O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Stable: No
In-place: Yes


Merge Sort

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
Stable: Yes
In-place: No


Quick Sort

Time Complexity: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst
Space Complexity: O(log n)
Stable: No
In-place: Yes



Performance Analysis
The implementation includes performance testing across three scenarios:

Best Case (Already sorted array)
Average Case (Randomly ordered array)
Worst Case (Reverse sorted array)
